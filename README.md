# short description
Doke sounds dope, so why not?
simple Make + docker-compose to build Docker images ala Victor Farcic.



an easy way to have a CI pipeline with Docker and Make

# components:

- Makefile
- docker-compose-build.yml

# Run

- `make help` 

## TODO

- installation via curl | bash
- `make init`, to setup all the fill in the blanks (read -p)
