# Makefile 
This is where all your docker-compose commands are wrapped.

Instead of memorizing and typing or looking into your bash history (ctrl+R or `history|grep -- 'docker-compose'` )








## [.Makefile.settings.mk](./makefile.settings.md)

this is where some cosmetics happens and where some of the environment variables used as build-args are calculated.
